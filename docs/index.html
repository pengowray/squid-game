<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Click to attach an arm.</li>
  <li>Hold left mouse button to release all arms</li>
  <li>(optional) Arrow keys for free movement. You get a bonus achievement for not using keyboard (or you did on Kongregate anyway).</li>
  <li>Collect "arm coins" to receive additional tentacle arms.</li>
  <li>Goal: Collect all the coins to be disappointed that that's all there is. There is no level 2.</li>

<h2>About This Project</h2>
<p>
  This game was originally made in Adobe Flash in 2007. In one development version the balloons actually floated. I don't remember why they stopped doing that. Probably a bug. After releasing this travesty of a game I gave up on writing my own physics engines and started using the open source Box2D engine instead, which simulated physics far less jankily.
</p>
<p>
  Squid Game was made to be played on <a href="https://www.kongregate.com/en/games/Pengo/squid-game">kongregate.com</a> where it had integrated achievements and a scoreboard, but it's no longer be playable there. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251203091332/http://web.archive.org/screenshot/https://www.kongregate.com/en/games/Pengo/squid-game">archive screenshot</a>)
</p>
<p>
  With the end of Flash Player, it stopped being playable. Thanks to the Ruffle project, I can finally make it "playable" online again. It's still not very playable, but you can play it. Have fun.
